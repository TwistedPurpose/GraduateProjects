Please answer the following questions:

1. After looking at the results, what cache coherence policy seems better?
Invalidate or update?  Why?

Update seems the better of the two methods.  While there is a large amount of waste from useless updates, there is also a substantially higher rate of write hits and a marginal increase of read hits.

Despite the large amount of useless updates, the cost of invalidation is close to the same.

2. Describe two different "threats to validity" due to shortcomings in the
simulator. Note: The threats to validity must be related to shortcomings
in the simulator and not other factors (such as the input data).

The simulator is serial and thus doesn't accurately simulate parallel activity.  If parallelism were implemented, it doesn't take into account data consistency.

3. Describe how you would address these shortcomings in the simulator.  Your
answer must not only describe "what" you would add but also "how" you would
add it. 

Each "processor" would be put into a thread to simulate parallelism.  To simulate the data consistency of the system, locks would be added to the processors to ensure a form of data consistency.
